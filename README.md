Hi ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for visiting my profile.
Iâ€™ve operated as a senior web and software developer for the 5 years. Combined with my B.Sc. in Computer science, those years have allowed me to build skills as a full-stack developer, 
specializing in writing smart contracts for DeFi, ERC-20, ERC-721 tokens and dApps as well as full stack web development 
through the use of PHP and JavaScript frameworks (especially blockchain-based applications).

My blockchain experience is extensive, having worked with blockchain since 2018. 
I have built DeFis, Dapps, Token and NFT minting projects, as well as having worked with smart contracts in Solidity and Rust.

I am well-versed in the following programming languages:
PHP, Javascript, Node JS, Solidity, python, Rust, C/C++/C#.

also the following frameworks and library:
Angular, React, Next, Laravel, Express, Nest, Truffle, Remix, openzeppelin and Ether JS, web3 JS, Solana web3 JS.
Building state-of-the-art, easy-to-use, user-friendly websites and applications is truly a passion of mine and I am confident I would be an excellent addition to your organization. In addition to my knowledge base, I actively seek out new technologies and stay up-to-date on industry trends and advancements. This has allowed me to stay ahead of the curve and deliver exceptional work to all of my employers, including those I've worked for on a project basis.
